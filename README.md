# 🛡️ Brittney's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository highlights my journey into cybersecurity, showcasing my technical skills, tools I've mastered, and projects I've completed as I transition from healthcare to cyber defense.


🎯 **Elevator Pitch**  
Hi, I’m Brittney. I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a strong foundation in Python automation, SQL, and full-stack development through projects and certifications like the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

My experience as a certified pharmacy technician taught me how to work with sensitive data, follow strict compliance protocols, and stay calm under pressure—skills that directly apply to cybersecurity. One of my proudest moments was optimizing our Omnicell restocking workflow by analyzing medication usage data. That success sparked my passion for solving problems with data and systems.

I’m now eager to bring that same attention to detail and analytical mindset into a cybersecurity role where I can protect systems and help teams operate more securely and efficiently.
