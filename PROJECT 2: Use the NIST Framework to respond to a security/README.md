# 🧱 Project 2: Apply the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to a Security Incident

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to respond to a cybersecurity incident using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. The activity simulated a **real-world distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack** on a fictional multimedia company’s internal network, caused by a misconfigured firewall that allowed an overwhelming flood of ICMP packets to penetrate the system.

## 🧠 Scenario Summary

A fictional multimedia company experienced a **two-hour outage** caused by a DDoS attack that exploited an **unconfigured firewall**, allowing a flood of ICMP packets to overwhelm the internal network. Critical services were brought down, and the security team had to block ICMP traffic, shut down non-critical systems, and implement new protections.

As part of the response effort, I created a detailed **incident report** aligned with NIST CSF functions, focusing on:

- **Asset identification and vulnerability awareness**
- **Protection and access control improvements**
- **Detection via IDS/IPS and network monitoring**
- **Incident response planning and containment**
- **Recovery strategies and resilience improvements**

As a cybersecurity analyst, I conducted a full incident analysis and created a response plan based on the five core functions of the NIST CSF:
- **Identify**
- **Protect**
- **Detect**
- **Respond**
- **Recover**
  
## 🧾 Objectives

- Analyze a simulated DDoS incident and determine root causes  
- Use the **NIST CSF** to assess the organization’s security posture  
- Apply best practices to improve future incident handling and mitigation  
- Document findings and recommendations in a formal **Incident Report Analysis**  
- Strengthen my cybersecurity portfolio with a real-world scenario response
