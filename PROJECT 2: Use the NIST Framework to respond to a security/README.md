# ðŸ§± Project 2: Apply the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to a Security Incident

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to respond to a cybersecurity incident using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The activity simulated a **real-world distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on a fictional multimedia companyâ€™s internal network, caused by a misconfigured firewall that allowed an overwhelming flood of ICMP packets to penetrate the system.

As a cybersecurity analyst, I conducted a full incident analysis and created a response plan based on the five core functions of the NIST CSF:

- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover
