# 🛡️ Project 4: Analyze a Vulnerable System for a Small Business

## 📘 Project Overview
This project highlights my ability to perform a **vulnerability assessment** for a small business by analyzing risks to a public-facing remote database server. Acting as a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company, I identified and evaluated security threats using the **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** risk management framework and created a remediation strategy to improve the company's security posture.

The remote server stores customer lead data and has been left open to public access since the company’s launch. My task was to assess the **potential business risks**, provide a qualitative analysis of the threats, and recommend security controls that reduce the attack surface and protect critical business functions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and define the **system architecture and scope** of the vulnerable asset  
- Apply the **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** methodology for identifying threat sources and events  
- Assess the **likelihood and severity** of specific threats to the database server  
- Use qualitative analysis to calculate overall **risk scores**  
- Recommend appropriate **remediation and mitigation strategies** using industry best practices  

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used
- 📖 **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** framework  
- 🔎 Risk identification and scoring  
- 🧠 Qualitative vulnerability assessment  
- 🛠️ Security control recommendations (MFA, Least Privilege, PKI, etc.)  
- 📝 Technical writing and risk communication
