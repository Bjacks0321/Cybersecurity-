# 🔍 Project 1: Conduct a Security Audit – Botium Toys

## 📘 Overview
This project involved performing an **internal IT security audit** for a fictional company, **Botium Toys**, as part of my cybersecurity portfolio development. The activity was designed to simulate a real-world auditing scenario. I applied foundational cybersecurity principles to identify risks, assess current security controls, and evaluate compliance using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.

# Ficitonal Scenerio
Botium Toys is a small U.S.-based business that has experienced rapid growth in its online market. The IT manager is concerned about scaling securely, complying with payment regulations, and addressing international standards (such as the European Union’s GDPR). My task was to support their goals by reviewing their audit scope, identifying managed assets, and assessing risk factors related to business continuity, compliance, and potential threats.
