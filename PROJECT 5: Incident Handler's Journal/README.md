# 🔐 Project 5: Incident Handler’s Journal — Overview

## 📘 Project Purpose
This project aimed to simulate the role of an incident handler working in a Security Operations Center (SOC). Through real-world scenarios and hands-on technical labs, I practiced documenting incidents and analyzing threats using industry-standard tools and frameworks.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Document security incidents using the 5 W’s (Who, What, When, Where, Why).
- Perform technical investigations using tools like **Wireshark**, **tcpdump**, and **VirusTotal**.
- Identify and classify **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** using the **Pyramid of Pain** model.
- Reflect on outcomes and lessons learned from each incident or lab experience.

## 📂 Journal Entry Categories
This project includes four journal entries, organized into two categories:

### 🧾 Documented Incident Investigation Entries  
Simulated incident scenarios following a real-world response workflow:
- **Entry #1: Ransomware Attack Documentation**
- **Entry #4: Investigating a Suspicious File + Pyramid of Pain Mapping**

### 🧪 Technical Tool Practice Entries  
Hands-on labs exploring packet capture and analysis:
- **Entry #2: Wireshark Packet Analysis**
- **Entry #3: Capturing Network Traffic with tcpdump**

## 📄 Important Note:
> 🔎 **To review the detailed activity overviews and step-by-step breakdowns for each journal entry, please refer to this project's `README.md` file.**  
> The `README.md` explains the purpose, scenario, and tasks for each entry in my own words and serves as the full narrative for this submission.
