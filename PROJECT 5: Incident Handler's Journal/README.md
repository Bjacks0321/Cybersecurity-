🔐 Project 5: Incident Handler’s Journal — Overview

📘 Project Purpose

This project aims to simulate the role of an incident handler in a Security Operations Center (SOC). I documented cybersecurity incidents and hands-on lab experiences throughout the project using a structured journal. Each entry demonstrates critical thinking, tool usage, and an understanding of incident response procedures based on real-world scenarios and industry tools.

🎯 Learning Objectives

- Practice documenting incidents using the 5 W’s (Who, What, When, Where, Why).
- Apply technical tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and VirusTotal.
- Identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) using industry-standard methodologies such as the Pyramid of Pain.
- Reflect on challenges and key learnings throughout the incident response process.

📂 Attached Document

Incident handler's journal(1) .pdf
This document includes all four entries for your Project 5 journal. It contains:
📝 Entry #1: Ransomware Attack (scenario-based)
📝 Entry #2: Wireshark Packet Analysis (tool-based lab)
📝 Entry #3: Capture My First Packet (tool-based lab)
📝 Entry #4: Investigating a Suspicious File (scenario-based using VirusTotal)

🗂️ Supporting Document Organization
  
The journal entries are separated into two categories:
1. Document Incident Investigation Entries
Real-world simulations following the incident response lifecycle.
2. Technical Tool Practice Entries
Labs focused on learning how to use packet analysis tools.
