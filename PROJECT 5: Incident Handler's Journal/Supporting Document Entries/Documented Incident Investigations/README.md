üîç 1. Investigate a Suspicious File
File: Investigate a Suspicious File.pdf‚Äã

Overview:
This activity simulates an alert in a SOC environment where an employee downloads a password-protected spreadsheet that delivers a malicious payload. Using VirusTotal, you analyze the file's hash and uncover Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as domains, IPs, and behavioral traits. This assignment forms the basis of Entry #4 in your journal.

Key Concepts Covered:
SHA256 hash analysis
VirusTotal tool usage
Timeline of malicious execution
Use of the Pyramid of Pain to classify IoCs

Pyramid of Pain
File: Pyramid of Pain.pdf‚Äã

Overview:
This PowerPoint outlines the results of your VirusTotal investigation. You populate the Pyramid of Pain with specific IoCs extracted from the malicious file analysis, including:
Hash values
IP address (114.149.208.238)
Domain (org.misecure.com)
Malware name: Flagpro

Relevance: Supports Entry #4 by mapping detected IoCs to their threat level, demonstrating your knowledge of threat hunting frameworks.

üõ°Ô∏è2. Documenting a Ransomware Attack
File: Documenting Ransomware Attack.pdf‚Äã

Overview:
This scenario-based exercise involves documenting a ransomware incident at a small U.S. healthcare clinic. The attack was delivered via a phishing email and caused widespread disruption.

Relevance: Provides the basis for Entry #1, where you applied the 5 W‚Äôs and drafted a real-world style incident handler‚Äôs journal entry.
