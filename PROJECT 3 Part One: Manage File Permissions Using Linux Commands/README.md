# Project 3 Part One: Manage File Permissions in Linux

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to manage file permissions using **Linux command-line tools**, a fundamental skill in cybersecurity for protecting sensitive data and maintaining proper authorization. In this hands-on activity, I acted as a security professional supporting a research team at a large organization. My responsibility was to **verify and update file and directory permissions** in a simulated Linux environment.

Through a series of tasks, I used Linux commands to analyze and update file permissions following organizational policies, ensuring that only authorized users had the appropriate access levels. This project builds on my knowledge of the Linux operating system and reinforces my ability to use commands like `ls -la` and `chmod` to control access at the file system level.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze current permissions using `ls -la`
- Interpret the 10-character string that defines file and directory permissions
- Use `chmod` to modify file and directory access
- Apply appropriate access levels for **hidden files**, **user/group permissions**, and **restricted directories**
- Demonstrate command output and reasoning through screenshots and detailed explanations

## 🧰 Tools & Commands Used

- `ls -la` – To list all files (including hidden files) and display permission details  
- `chmod` – To change file and directory permission modes  
- `chown` – To confirm or adjust ownership where applicable  
- `cd` and `pwd` – To navigate and validate directory paths  

## 🗂️ Files in This Repository

- `file_permissions_linux_template.md` – Completed version of the Linux permissions template    
- `Supporting Documents` – Folder containing materials and raw notes
