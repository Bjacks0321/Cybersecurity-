# 🧮 Project 3 – Part Two: Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to use **SQL filters** to query data and investigate potential cybersecurity incidents. In a simulated scenario, I took on the role of a **security professional** analyzing suspicious login activity and employee machine data. By leveraging SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE`, I was able to retrieve relevant records from organizational databases to identify threats and support internal investigations.

This work highlights my ability to **write efficient SQL queries**, a key skill in cybersecurity for analyzing logs, identifying anomalies, and managing sensitive user data.

## 🧠 Scenario Summary
As part of my duties as a cybersecurity analyst at a large organization, I conducted a SQL-based investigation into **suspicious login activity** and **departmental employee access**:

- Queried failed login attempts after business hours (after 18:00)  
- Reviewed login activity on and before **May 9, 2022** for a potential incident  
- Filtered logins **outside of Mexico** using pattern matching  
- Identified employees in the **Marketing department** located in **East building offices**  
- Queried employees from **Sales OR Finance departments** for targeted updates  
- Isolated all employees **not in the Information Technology department** for broader updates
  
## 🎯 Objectives

-  Use SQL filters to extract targeted data from tables  
-  Investigate after-hours failed login attempts  
-  Analyze login activity tied to specific dates and countries  
-  Identify employees based on department and office location  
-  Use logical operators and pattern matching (`LIKE`) for advanced queries  
-  Support security investigations using relational database analysis  

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used
- SQL Query Language  
- `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, `IN` clauses  
- Logical and conditional filtering  
- Pattern matching  
- Data retrieval and analysis for security incidents
